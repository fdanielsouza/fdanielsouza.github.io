# multiInfoCards Power BI Custom Visual

This page is intended to provide support and relevant information about the development process of the visual. 

## How to use the visual

Add a category field in Titles and either an image field in Images or a measure in Informations. The visual can show up to 8 measures. Also you can include measures in Tooltips field to show in a default Power BI tooltip, or use the Report Page canvas tooltip. You can classify data by any value in the visual, cross-filter or highlight data in the same way the official Power BI visuals do, and multiselect using ctrl. Set a value for the individual cards width and customize background and texts with the options provided. If you need to transform numeric values to a display units format, you will need to first remove any formatting from your fields, otherwise the column/measure format should prevail. 

## Roadmap

* Conditional formatting for both background and texts
* Add text alignment options
